# DevOps Network Lab (Raspberry Pi 5)

This project sets up a secure, self-hosted infrastructure stack using Raspberry Pi 5, including DNS-level filtering, DHCP services, secure remote access (VPN), and monitoring.

## Components:

- Pi-hole (DNS + Ad-blocking)
- Dnsmasq (DHCP)
- Unbound (Recursive DNS Resolver)
- WireGuard (VPN)
- Prometheus + Grafana (Monitoring)

> Built as part of a DevOps lab environment to simulate real-world infrastructure with automation, observability, and security in mind.
